I'm a college student trying to get ahead of the curve. I'm a few years away from getting my bachelors, 
I'm studying program engineering and applied mathematics. 

despite the educational path im not very good with computers but im fascinated by them! mostly here to learn and study other people code but 
if anyone wants to send me some tips and teach me a few things I would be grateful! I like python i just get my PCEP-30-02 i'm hoping to get my PCAP
here soon. I also want to get into some adjacent programming languages (css, java, swift? im not sure currently trying to decide)
